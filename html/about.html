            Luca Marino worked as a public defender and attorney and for the
            first 20 years of his career. The exceptionally long hours of
            preparing for trials, meeting with clients, and arguing in court
            were made easier by another of Luca's life passions, coffee, and
            lots of it! After working on a greusome, high-profile felony case,
            Luca decided it was time for a break from legal work. Luca took a
            year off and traveled to the world's top coffee destinations,
            Brazil, Ethiopia, and Sumatra. While meeting local growers and
            tasting the best beans in the world, Luca decided to open a coffee
            shop in his home city of Vancouver, Canada. Sufficient Grounds was
            opened in the spring of 2018, becoming a local favorite for espresso
            and coffee afficionados. In 2019, Luca and star SG barista James
            Cooper made their debut at the Canadian National Barista
            Championship. James ousted the 4 year returning champion, earning
            the first place trophy - and major bragging rights!

            Sufficient Grounds coffee shop found early success, becoming one of
            Vancouver's best artisan coffee shops. Then, the Covid 19 pandemic
            hit. Although the shop continued to do well, it became an intense
            struggle to order coffee from abroad. Many businesses had shut down
            during the pandemic and worldwide shipping issues meant lower
            quality coffee. It was during this debacle that Luca and SG decided
            to expand into importing and roasting their own coffee. Luca
            contacted the growers he had met while traveling and found them
            eager to work with new importers. Sufficient Grounds continues to
            work with many of the same local growers that Luca met on his coffee
            world tour. Luca and members of the Sufficient Grounds team continue
            to travel the world, sourcing new flavours directly from the farmers
            that grow them.
